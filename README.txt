Quickly and easily add a mortgage calculator to your website

== Description ==

This plugin, from the creators of [Property Hive](https://wordpress.org/plugins/propertyhive/), allows you to quickly and easily add a mortgage calculator to your website.

Users simply enter the purchase price, deposit amount, interest rate and repayment period, then the repayment information is calculated instantly.

Note: This plugin is independent of Property Hive. You DO NOT need to be using Property Hive to download and use this plugin.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Property Hive, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type “Property Hive Mortgage Calculator” and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading the plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Updating should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

== Screenshots ==

1. Once you've added the shortcode the mortgage calculator becomes avalaible for people to complete
2. Users are instantly shown monthly repayment information once they've completed the form
